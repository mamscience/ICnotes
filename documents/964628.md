Lung and diaphragm-protective mechanical ventilation is an approach that aims to limit side effects of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. The approach centers on optimizing patient respiratory effort to avoid lung and diaphragm injury while maintaining acceptable respiratory homeostasis.{{cite inline|ref_nr=1}}
