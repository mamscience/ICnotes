Lung and diaphragm-protective mechanical ventilation is an approach that aims to limit side effects of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. The approach centers on optimizing patient respiratory effort to avoid lung and diaphragm injury while maintaining acceptable respiratory homeostasis.{{cite inline | ref_nr=1}}

## Principles of lung‐protective ventilation

Lung injury comprises
+ volutrauma/barotrauma: overdistension 
+ atelectrauma: repetitive tidal recruitment and collapse

To minimize total stress and strain, dependent regions (usually prone to atelectasis) often require recruitment while non-dependent regions (usually well ventilated) require relief of overdistension.

::: caution
Global indices like transpulmonary pressure and driving pressure do not reflect regional stress or strain.

## Principles of diaphragm‐protective ventilation

Mechanical ventilation delivered as the predominan breathing source can lead to diaphragm atrophy and injury with a substantial deleterious impact on patient
outcome. It is suggested that the diaphragm might be protected by titrating ventilation and sedation to restore early diaphragm activity while avoiding excess respiratory effort. {{cite inline | ref_nr=1}}
